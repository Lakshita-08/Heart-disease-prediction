# Heart-disease-prediction
Hearts are important to all living things. The diagnosis and prognosis of heart-related diseases require greater accuracy, perfection, and correctness because even a minor error can result in tiredness or even death. Heart-related deaths are common, and the number of these deaths is rising rapidly every day. An illness awareness prediction system is absolutely necessary to address the issue. Machine learning, a subfield of artificial intelligence, offers significant assistance in making predictions about any form of event using data from real-world occurrences. In this study, we evaluate the predictive power of machine learning algorithms for heart disease. K-nearest Neighbor, Decision Tree, Linear Regression, Support Vector Machine, and K means clustering are among the algorithms that were trained on the Kaggle dataset .
